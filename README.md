This code takes inspiration from here:

My goal with this project is to create a simulated environment for an 'engine running'
using the following hardware:
- NodeMCU Esp8266 12e (wifi capable esp)
- SW-420 vibration sensor

The ESP will record and save the total time that it detects vibration from the sensor.

Next Steps:
- Web server integration!!!
